## 29.03.2024 Web Programming Project Assignment / Turkish Airlines Static Version

**Cons:**
- I attempted to make it responsive, but some parts shift at different scales.
- Some areas that should have been buttons are in the form of lists and images; these areas need to be corrected when converted to dynamic form.
- Emojis were added by default; for a more elegant appearance, they should be added in img format.
- Announcement sections and similar areas were added as images; they should be converted into box shapes with borders.


**Display Resolution:** 2560x1440
**Scale:** 175%
